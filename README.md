## Projects

### 1. Python Generators (0x00)

**Directory:** [`python-generators-0x00/`](./python-generators-0x00/README.md)

**About the Project:**
This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

**Learning Objectives:**
By completing this project, you will:
-   **Master Python Generators:** Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
-   **Handle Large Datasets:** Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
-   **Simulate Real-world Scenarios:** Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
-   **Optimize Performance:** Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
-   **Apply SQL Knowledge:** Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

**Requirements:**
-   Proficiency in Python 3.x.
-   Understanding of `yield` and Python’s generator functions.
-   Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).
-   Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.
-   Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.
