# ALX Backend Python Projects

This repository serves as a collection of backend Python projects completed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It showcases various concepts and practical implementations in areas such as database interaction, API development, asynchronous programming, and efficient data handling.

Each sub-directory within this repository represents a distinct project or module, focusing on specific learning objectives and technical challenges.

## Projects

### 1. Python Generators (0x00)

**Directory:** [`python-generators-0x00/`](./python-generators-0x00/README.md)

**About the Project:**
This project introduces advanced usage of Python generators to efficiently handle large datasets, process data in batches, and simulate real-world scenarios involving live updates and memory-efficient computations. The tasks focus on leveraging Python’s `yield` keyword to implement generators that provide iterative access to data, promoting optimal resource utilization, and improving performance in data-driven applications.

**Learning Objectives:**
By completing this project, you will:
-   **Master Python Generators:** Learn to create and utilize generators for iterative data processing, enabling memory-efficient operations.
-   **Handle Large Datasets:** Implement batch processing and lazy loading to work with extensive datasets without overloading memory.
-   **Simulate Real-world Scenarios:** Develop solutions to simulate live data updates and apply them to streaming contexts.
-   **Optimize Performance:** Use generators to calculate aggregate functions like averages on large datasets, minimizing memory consumption.
-   **Apply SQL Knowledge:** Use SQL queries to fetch data dynamically, integrating Python with databases for robust data management.

**Requirements:**
-   Proficiency in Python 3.x.
-   Understanding of `yield` and Python’s generator functions.
-   Familiarity with SQL and database operations (MySQL and SQLite).
-   Basic knowledge of database schema design and data seeding.
-   Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and submission.

### 2. Python Decorators (0x01)

**Directory:** [`python-decorators-0x01/`](./python-decorators-0x01/README.md)

**About the Project:**
This project delves into the powerful concept of Python decorators, showcasing their application in enhancing database interaction logic without modifying the core functionality of the operations. Through a series of practical tasks, this module demonstrates how decorators can be used to add cross-cutting concerns like logging, connection management, transaction handling, retry mechanisms, and result caching to database functions in a clean, reusable, and maintainable way.

The tasks highlight the benefits of decorators in abstracting common patterns, promoting code reusability, and separating concerns within a backend application, particularly in the context of database operations.

**Learning Objectives:**
By completing this project, you will:
-   **Understand and Create Decorators:** Grasp the fundamental concept of Python decorators and learn to implement them to wrap and modify functions.
-   **Log Database Queries:** Implement a decorator to automatically log SQL queries and their execution times, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.
-   **Manage Database Connections:** Develop a decorator that handles the opening and closing of database connections, ensuring resources are properly managed and preventing connection leaks.
-   **Implement Transactional Logic:** Create a decorator to manage database transactions, ensuring atomicity by automatically committing changes on success or rolling back on error.
-   **Add Retry Mechanisms:** Design a decorator to automatically retry database operations that fail due to transient errors, improving application resilience.
-   **Cache Query Results:** Develop a decorator to cache the results of database queries, reducing redundant database calls and improving application performance.
-   **Apply Decorator Stacking:** Understand how to apply multiple decorators to a single function and the order of their execution.

**Requirements:**
-   Python 3.x
-   `sqlite3` module (standard library)
-   Familiarity with Python functions, arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`), and nested functions.
-   Basic understanding of SQL and database interactions.
-   Familiarity with error handling (`try-except-finally`).
-   Ability to use Git and GitHub for version control.
